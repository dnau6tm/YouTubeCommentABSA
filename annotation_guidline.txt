Annotation Guidelines 

Based on the characteristics of students’ feedback, we build annotation guidelines for sentiment and topic tasks. 
1) Sentiment-Based Task: Each sentence is labeled one of three sentiment polarities including positive, negative, and neutral. 
Annotation guidelines are briefly described as follows. 
• Positive polarity: Sentences in which use to express their satisfaction and compliments about elements of player, managers, etc. 
For instance, the sentence "Ronaldo đá hay quá =) :)") is annotated with the positive polarity. 
• Negative polarity: Sentences express dissatisfaction, requests, and complaints related to players, style, manager, and so on. 
An example sentence which is "Mac Gui đá quá tệ =( :(" (means: "The course content is too much for students.") is a sentence expressed
 the negative emotion. 
• Neutral polarity: Sentences are incomplete or unclear in meaning or do not contain opinions, for instance, the sentence "=) ;)" is
 a neutral sentence which is actually a noun phrase and does not contain any words expressing emotions. Or, sentences are complete but
  do not express feelings. For example, the sentence "he”.


Annotation Process 

To ensure the quality of corpus, we try to build the basic guidelines as completely as possible before starting the annotation process.
In addition, we also update the annotation guidelines during the annotation process, which is necessary because there are many complicated
cases. In this annotation process, we ask the annotators to discuss difficult cases if they find and update the guidelines. 
After updating the guidelines, we re-train the annotators with the revised guidelines. Eventually, we evaluate the corpus based on 
inter-annotator agreements and classification experiments.
